    ">Can we use NLP to accurately predict if a userâ€™s beauty/skincare problem is best answered in the AsianBeauty subreddit?\n",
    "\n",
    "I conclude, yes, Ask Gigi can accurately predict if a user's beauty/skincare problem is best answered in the AsianBeauty subreddit approx. 90% of the time with better odds for topics in the Top 20 word with strong coefficient weights (see chart below).\n",

    "## Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend using the Logistic Regression model for the production of Ask Gigi beta, so we can at least start user-testing and monitor the Reddit bounce rate for the first 3 months to measure success.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "1. Fine tuning keywords and stopwords to improve model accuracy.\n",
    "2. Monitor KPI and model performance at first.\n",
    "3. Build a model to see which topics are best covered by SkincareAddiction.\n",
    "4. Ask Gigi user testing: Is there mention the key words at all? Adjust model accordingly.\n",
    "5. Explore other subreddits and mediums to recommend to users, scale Ask Gigi."
